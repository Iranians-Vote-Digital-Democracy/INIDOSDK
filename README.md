## **OPEN SDK for IRANIAN NATIONAL IDENTITY CARD**

More than 63 million Iranians hold the Iranian National Identity smart card [NID](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA_%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AF_%D9%85%D9%84%DB%8C).  
Goal of this project is to create _zero-knowledge proofs_ of identity, using the NID. For more information please read our [paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18kjUKhLuJ0IfRMrl2NZBXwipya2fKVqmXfLsZpZE9bQ/) and visit our [main project](https://github.com/Iranians-Vote-Digital-Democracy).

National Organization for Civil Registration is the main body in charge of the NIDs in Iran, and [Matiran Co.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/matiran/about/), is the main developer of the software related to the cards. The state-developed SDK we worked on in this project is responsible for communicating with the card.

We are investigating Matiran's protected SDK which is used by 3rd party KYC and Digital signatures services e.g. [Dastine](pki.co.ir).
